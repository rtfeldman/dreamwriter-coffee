<h1>This is Dreamwriter</h1>
<h3>
★ &nbsp;It backs up your words as you type &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
★ &nbsp;It makes organizing your masterpiece easy&nbsp;<br>
★ &nbsp;It works offline for airplane writing &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<h2>Streamlined Writing</h2>
<div>You’re a writer. Your writing tools should help you spend more time writing, and less time on chores like managing backups and revisions.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>
Dreamwriter automatically saves your work as you type, while making backup copies both on your computer and on remote servers. Sign in anywhere and pick up right where you left off.
</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>
You can also bring it up offline. (Ever seen a website do that? Try it: turn off your Internet connection and visit this page again. Great for in-flight writing!)
</div>
<h2>1. Editor</h2>
<div>This central box is your trusty Editor. Try changing this sentence to read simply “Excellent.”</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Along the bottom, the spectacular <i>hide distractions</i> button fades away everything but these words. Try it out!</div>
<h2>2. Outline</h2>
<div>
To the left is your document’s Outline. Try clicking the title (“This is Dreamwriter”) and chapters to navigate around.
</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>
Click this paragraph, then <i>insert</i> and then <i>chapter</i>. (Note the automatic chapter numbering.) Title the new chapter “Great Stuff”. Notice the Outline keeps up with each change, even when you delete the new chapter.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>
To rename this document, simply scroll to the top and edit the title heading. If you like word counts, try the “stats” button!</div>
<h2>3. Notes</h2><div>Try highlighting this sentence and clicking <i>add note</i> in the lower right. Then type “this was helpful” and click back here.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>
The note you just added will exist in the margin only. It will not alter the text of the document, even when printing. The arrows next to <i>add note</i> will cycle through all your notes.
</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>
Mouse over a note to see what it references. Once you no longer need it, the X in its corner will delete it.
</div>
<h2>Happy writing!</h2>
