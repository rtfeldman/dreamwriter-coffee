<h2>Streamlined Writing</h2>
<div>
Dreamwriter automatically saves your work as you type, while making backup copies both on your computer and on Dropbox. Sign in anywhere and pick up right where you left off.
</div>
<h2>1. Editor</h2>
<div>This central box is your trusty Editor. Try changing this sentence to read simply “Excellent.”</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Along the bottom, the spectacular <i>hide distractions</i> button fades away everything but these words. Try it out!</div>
<h2>2. Outline</h2>
<div>
To the left is your document’s Outline. Try clicking the title (“This is Dreamwriter”) and chapters to navigate around.
</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>
Click this paragraph, then <i>insert</i> and then <i>chapter</i>. (Note the automatic chapter numbering.) Title the new chapter “Great Stuff”. Notice the Outline keeps up with each change, even when you delete the new chapter.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>
To rename this document, simply scroll to the top and edit the title heading. If you like word counts, try the “stats” button!</div>
<h2>3. Notes</h2><div>Try typing “Note to self about Chapter 1” into the area to the right of the editor.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>
The note you just added will exist in the margin only. It will not alter the text of the document, even when printing.
</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>
Use this space to jot down as many notes as you need! If you need more space, a scroll bar will appear.
</div>
